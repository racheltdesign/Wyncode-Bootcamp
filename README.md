Objects-everything Ruby understands

Classes-different kinds of objects

something.class = what is your class? What can you do?

.something= a method: something an object is capable of doing

Integer class = whole number

Float class = partial numbers (fractions, decimals etc.)

Floats are DANGEROUS, they’re not perfectly accurate

Once you use a float, floats will be returned for everything. Like a virus, called “float infection”

 "hello!".delete(“!”)-Argument
=> "hello”-RETURN = object.method notation

Object is the noun, method the verb: “Run Forrest!” = forrest.run

"HELLO!".downcase.delete("!") = method chaining, executes left to right, one at a time

Don’t sacrifice readability for performance

variable= bucket, a named object that stores something

/n = new line character, equivalent of hitting return

.chomp = removes returns and spaces from user input

.to_i = converts string to integer, all user input is automatically a string

.to_s = converts to string

Remember: You're never going to remember everything, but you will remember- there's SOMETHING that does that, and you know how to find it

Conditional - a statement that is either true or false, used by if to determine what to do

Control flow- controlling what runs and what doesn’t

DRY = Don’t repeat yourself

Wet code = repetitive code

Loop = an instruction to repeat a line of code

array = a collection of objects (an object that holds other objects)

method + ! = mutator - a mutator permanently changes your data, the exclamation is a warning. users.capitalize! will permanently capitalize users’ names in an array. Mutators are dangerous
