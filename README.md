Objects-everything Ruby understands

Classes-different kinds of objects

something.class = what is your class? What can you do?

.something= a method: something an object is capable of doing

Integer class = whole number

Float class = partial numbers (fractions, decimals etc.)

Floats are DANGEROUS, they’re not perfectly accurate

Once you use a float, floats will be returned for everything. Like a virus, called “float infection”

 "hello!".delete(“!”)-Argument
=> "hello”-RETURN = object.method notation

Object is the noun, method the verb: “Run Forrest!” = forrest.run

"HELLO!".downcase.delete("!") = method chaining, executes left to right, one at a time

Don’t sacrifice readability for performance

variable= bucket, a named object that stores something

/n = new line character, equivalent of hitting return

.chomp = removes returns and spaces from user input

.to_i = converts string to integer, all user input is automatically a string

.to_s = converts to string
